Dear Leo Dictionary Workflow users,

Today (2017-03-17 09:52) I received a polite e-mail from the company that runs Leo Dictionary asking me to remove all occurrences of this workflow as it does violate their terms of usage. They need the money generated from ads to run their free business and by providing this tool you won't generate any clicks and hits.

They still allowed the private usage of the tool (so if you have it, keep it), but I may not publicly provide the tool any further.

Sincerely,

psistorm
